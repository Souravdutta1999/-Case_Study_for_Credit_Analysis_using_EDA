# -Case_Study_for_Credit_Analysis_using_EDA
Used exploratory data analysis to solve the problem of the company to determine the customers who will likely to default on their bank loans.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This case study aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their instalments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.

In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.
